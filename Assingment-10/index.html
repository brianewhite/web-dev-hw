    <h1>The Three Little Pigs</h1>
    <h2>An English Fairytale</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs.
        One pig built a house of straw while the second pig
        built his house with sticks. They built their houses
        very quickly and then sang and danced all day because
         they were lazy. The third little pig worked hard all
          day and built his house with bricks. </p>

          <p> A big bad wolf saw the two little pigs while they danced
and played and thought,
“What juicy tender meals they will make!” </p>
