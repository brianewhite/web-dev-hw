    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <p>Came into this world
Daddy's little girl</p>
<p>And daddy made a soldier out of me
  Daddy made me dance
  And daddy held my hand
  And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
  And we rode motorcycles
  Blackjack, classic vinyl
  Tough girl is what I had to be</p>
  <p>He said take care of your mother
  Watch out for your sister
  Oh, and that's when he gave to me
  With his gun, with his head held high
  He told me not to cry</p>
  <p>Oh, my daddy said shoot
  Oh, my daddy said shoot
  With his right hand on his rifle
  He swore it on the bible
  My daddy said shoot
  Oh, my daddy said shoot</p>
  <p>He held in his arms
  And he taught me to be strong
  He told me when he's gone
  Here's what you do
  When trouble comes to town
  And men like me come around
  Oh, my daddy said shoot
  Oh, my daddy said shoot</p>
  <p>Daddy made me fight
  It wasn't always right
  But he said girl it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh
  He always played it cool
  But daddy was no fool
  And right before he died he said remember</p>
  <p>He said take care of your mother
  Watch out for your sister
  And that's when daddy looked at me
  With his gun, with his head held high
  He told me not to cry
  Oh, my daddy said shoot
  Oh, my daddy said shoot</p>
  <p>With his right hand on his rifle
  He swore it on the bible
  My daddy said shoot
  Oh, my daddy said shoot
  He held me in his arms
  And he taught me to be strong
  He told me when he's gone
  Here's what you do</p>
  <p>When trouble comes to town
  And men like me come around
  Oh, my daddy said shoot
  Oh, my daddy said shoot</p>
  <p>My daddy warned me about men like you
  He said baby girl he's playing you
  He's playing you
  My daddy warned me about men like you
  He said baby girl he's playing you
  He's playing you</p>
  <p>Cause when trouble comes in town
  And men like me come around
  Oh, my daddy said shoot
  Oh, my daddy said shoot</p>
  <p>Cause when trouble comes to town
  And men like me come around
  Oh, my daddy said shoot
  Oh, my daddy said shoot</p>
