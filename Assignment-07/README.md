Divs are just kind of like sub divisions of elements in the page. They are identified by ids and classes. The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.
Alt text specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed. The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it, so at least they wouldn't be looking at a blank page.
I set up the document as usual. established the divs, and then I added the media at the end. I struggled with the MART video though...I'm not sure what exactly I was doing wrong there.
