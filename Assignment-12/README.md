I guess I could loosely say that this could potentially be a photography page, where my clients would be people looking for their photos to be taken.
Display inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not
I still struggle to connect all my pages to the style page.. I just don't quite understand how to do that. Also my fonts don't seem to be appearing... so I'm unsure of what I need to do there.
